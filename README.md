# weather-dashboard
For this Server-Side APIs Challenge, I created a web page that allows the user to search for weather data using the OpenWeather api.
UserS can enter a city name to search for, the application then calls OpenWeather through a series of api calls to return the folowing information:
current temperature
current humidity
current wind speed
current uv index
weather icons corresponding to the current weather
5-day forecast consisting of date, temperature, humidity, and the corresponding weather icons.
